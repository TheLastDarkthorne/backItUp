# backItUp

Hi! This is a [Mudlet](https://mudlet.org/) package lets you backup the super important help scrolls so meticulously written an maintained in your Achaean organization literally over centuries of game time. Its operation is quite simple, and here's how:

## Backup CITY Scrolls

> `backup chelp`

## Backup ORDER Scrolls

> `backup ohelp`

## Backup HOUSE Scrolls

> `backup hhelp`

## Backup a Clan's Scrolls

> `CLAN SWITCH <clanname>`  
> `backup clhelp`

### How to import

1. You'll want to hit Alt-O to open the package manager
2. Click on the little 'Install' button
3. Locate the [xml file](https://github.com/adayoung/backItUp/blob/master/backItUp.xml) you've downloaded from here
4. Click Open! That should be it :grin:
5. You'll want to look at Scripts > BackItUp and ensure backItUp.CommandSeparator is what it needs to be. The default is '|' which is Achaea's default as well
6. Oh blimey, and do CONFIG PAGELENGTH 250 as well before starting backup or things will get cut off at the MORE prompt

### How to upgrade

1. You'll want to hit Alt-O to open the package manager
2. Select backItUp from the list
3. Click the 'Uninstall' button
4. Start again from [How to import](#how-to-import)

It's quite simple really! A little spammy but I'm sure you wouldn't mind it for a copy of everything, EVERYTHING!

If you don't know what Achaea is, you should probably come over here at https://achaea.com/ and make a character and play with us!
