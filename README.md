# backItUp

Hi! This is a [Mudlet](https://mudlet.org/) package lets you backup the super important help scrolls so meticulously written an maintained in your Achaean organization literally over centuries of game time. Its operation is quite simple, and here's how:

## Backup CITY Scrolls

> `backup chelp`

## Backup ORDER Scrolls

> `backup ohelp`

## Backup HOUSE Scrolls

> `backup hhelp`

## Backup a Clan's Scrolls

> `CLAN SWITCH <clanname>`  
> `backup clhelp`

### How to import

1. You'll want to hit Alt-O to open the package manager
2. Click on the little 'Install' button
3. Locate the [xml file](https://github.com/adayoung/backItUp/blob/master/backItUp.xml) you've downloaded from here
4. Click Open! That should be it :grin:

It's quite simple really! Albeit spammy but I'm sure you wouldn't mind it for a copy of everything, EVERYTHING!

If you don't know what Achaea is, you should probably come over here at https://achaea.com/ and make a character and play with us!
